# Salesforce Athenaeum Project
The Salesforce Athenaeum project strives to provide viable, production-ready Salesforce assets built to solve real problems. These tools were born from client implementations and refined over years of work in the Salesforce ecosystem—extracted, abstracted, and made reusable.

## Assets
| Asset | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [BulkDeleteRecords](./bulk-delete-records) | Production-ready batch Apex class for safely deleting large volumes of Salesforce records with comprehensive error handling, monitoring, and configurable behavior. |
